This directory contains an example for averaging off-axis holographic reconstructions.
The data files for the reconstruction can be downloaded as zip-archive from the site

    https://doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-6674

Unzip the file into this directory. This directory contains a parameter file for the reconstruction of the data files:

    holoaverage-a1.json

To reconstruct and average the data, go to your command execute the following script in the console (command prompt):

    holoaverage -v holoaverage-a1.json

Here the -v enables verbose output.

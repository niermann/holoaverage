Outputs
=======

Within the parameter file the output filename is specified by the :ref:`param-output` parameter. This output file
will always be a HDF5 file.

This file typically holds three datasets:

The dataset ``data`` contains the averaged reconstruction of the (drift aligned) object holograms. If the defocus value
for the individual holograms (as specified by the parameters :ref:`param-defocus_first` and :ref:`param-defocus_step` is
not zero, the holograms are propagated to the zero defocus. The dataset ``empty`` contains the averaged
reconstruction of the empty holograms.

As HDF5 files do not support datasets of complex numbers, the datasets are stored as a compound data type of 8 bytes
length. The compound has two members, both 32 bit floats. The first member ``r`` at byte offset 0, contains the real
part of the complex numbers, the second member ``i`` at byte offset 4 the imaginary part. This convention is recognized
by HDF5 python library (`<http://www.h5py.org>`_) and the HDF5 Digital Micrograph plugin (
`<https://github.com/niermann/gms_plugin_hdf5>`_).

The dataset ``variance`` contains the estimate of the per-pixel variance of the object hologram series (drift aligned
and propagated to zero defocus), this is stored as 32 bit float.

The datasets ``data`` and ``variance`` are not present, when the object hologram reconstruction is disabled, by omitting
the :ref:`param-object_names` parameter. The dataset ``empty`` is not present, when the empty hologram reconstruction
is disabled by omitting the :ref:`param-empty_names` parameter.

If the parameter :ref:`param-output_series` is set, additional a group ``series`` is present in the output file,
which contains datasets ``000``, ``001``, ``002``, etc. These contain the reconstruction of the individual holograms
in the object series. The dataset ``000`` refers to the first hologram (as specified by the parameter
:ref:`param-object_names` and :ref:`param-object_first`). The consecutive numbers refer to the consecutive holograms
in the series. These are also stored as complex valued datasets.

If the parameter :ref:`param-output_aligned` is set, additional a group ``aligned_rois`` is present in the output file,
which contains datasets ``000``, ``001``, ``002``, etc. These contain the region of interest (parameter
:ref:`param-roi`) as tracked across the object series in the raw-alignment step. The datatype of the dataset is
typically the datatype used in the image files.

Additional the datasets/groups have attributes, which contain further metadata. Not all the
following attributes are present in all datasets. This list is incomplete.

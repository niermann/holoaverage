Overview
========

Holoaverage is a Python script for the reconstruction and averaging of series of off-axis electron holograms, typically
recorded in transmission electron holograms. The averaging is performed iteratively, such that instabilities of
the microscope, like specimen and biprism drifts, can be tracked and corrected between consecutive exposures.

The script is written and maintained by Tore Niermann (email: tore.niermann@tu-berlin.de).

Details on the usage can be found in the tutorial section of the documentation. The documentation can be
found at

.. _sec-installation:

Installation
------------

The script is a Python script. Thus, a working Python distribution is required for running it. It is designed
to run under Python 2.7 and Python 3. Beside the Python interpreter it requires the following
packages:

    * numpy (see `<www.numpy.org>`_)
    * scipy (see `<www.scipy.org>`_)
    * h5py (see `<www.hypy.org>`_)
    * pyFFTW is optional; speeds up the averaging (see `<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFFTW>`_)

The package is tested with Python versions 2.7 and 3.5, numpy version 1.11.0, scipy version 0.18.0, h5py version 2.6.0
and version PyFFTW 0.10.4.

The package can be most conveniently using the ``pip`` package manager. Make sure you have Python installed (either 2.X
or 3.X) and the ``pip`` program is in your path. Go to the command line and execute (if you use Python 2.7 use ``pip``
instead of ``pip3``).

::

    pip3 install --upgrade holoaverage

Holoaverage leverages the pyFFTW package for speed. If pyfftw can not be installed you can still use holoaverage
without problems. You can install pyFFTW by (with Python 2.7 again use ``pip`` instead of ``pip3``)

::

    pip3 install --upgrade pyfftw

Up to date source versions can be found on the GitHub site:

    https://github.com/niermann/holoaverage

Usage
-----

The above installation steps install the ``holoaverage`` command line script (make sure you're python distribution's
script directory is in the path).

The ``holoaverage`` script has the following syntax:

::

    holoaverage [-v] parameter-file

    The parameter file is a JSON file. See the documentation for details.
    If "-" is passed as parameter file name, the parameters are read from stdin.

    Options:
        -v Verbose

Bug reporting
-------------

When `reporting a bug <https://github.com/niermann/holoaverage/issues>`_ please include:

    * Your operating system name and version.
    * Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
    * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
